# Hi there, I'm Nimish Jain üëã



I'm a passionate and detail-oriented **Machine Learning Engineer** and a Computer Science student at Vellore Institute of Technology. My journey into AI began with a fascination for how data can be transformed into intelligent, actionable insights. Today, I specialize in building robust systems that leverage **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** to solve complex, real-world challenges.

My core philosophy is to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical, deployable solutions. I have hands-on experience in the entire machine learning lifecycle‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and feature engineering to model architecture design, training, and performance optimization. I thrive on tackling problems that require not just technical skill but also a deep understanding of the problem domain, whether it's enhancing workplace safety, securing digital identities, or aiding in medical diagnostics.

## üéØ What I'm Currently Focused On

I believe in continuous learning and applying my skills to new and challenging domains. Here's a snapshot of my current interests and goals:

-   üß† **Interpretability & XAI**: I'm deeply curious about the "why" behind model predictions and am actively learning techniques to build more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

-   üöÄ **End-to-End ML**: Moving beyond just model building, I'm focusing on the complete MLOps lifecycle, from containerization and deployment to monitoring and maintenance.

-   üî¨ **AI Research**: I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to research work, particularly in computer vision, security, and the application of AI in science.

-   üìä **Data-Driven Insights**: I'm leveraging my experience in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to ensure that every model I build is not only accurate but also grounded in a solid understanding of the data it's trained on.

## üöÄ My Projects

Here's a deeper dive into some of my key projects. Each repository contains detailed documentation and the source code.

### üõ°Ô∏è SafeSite AI ‚Äì PPE Safety Detection & Compliance System
*An intelligent system to enhance workplace safety through real-time monitoring of Personal Protective Equipment.*


<img src="https://github.com/NimishJ24/NimishJ24/blob/main/asset/crowded.jpg" height="300"><img src="https://github.com/NimishJ24/NimishJ24/blob/main/asset/helmet2.jpg" height="300"> <br>

This project addresses a critical gap in industrial safety by moving beyond simple presence detection of PPE. The system uses a **YOLOv8** model to detect 6 classes of safety gear and, crucially, employs a custom rule-based engine and **pose estimation** to verify that the equipment is being worn correctly. This novel approach, which is the subject of an **ongoing patent process**, drastically reduces false positives and provides an auditable log for compliance. The model achieved a **mAP@50 of 0.959** on a dataset of over 3,800 annotated images.

### üß† Sequential-Behavioral Mining for Adaptive Authentication
*A self-adaptive security system that models user behavior to detect anomalies and dynamically adjust authentication requirements.*

This project reimagines authentication security by creating a system that learns a user's unique digital "fingerprint." It continuously monitors sequential behavioral data‚Äîlike **keystroke dynamics (typing speed, error rate), mouse movements, and application focus**‚Äîusing unsupervised learning models like **Isolation Forests**. When behavior deviates from the established norm, the system flags it as an anomaly and can trigger a secondary challenge, like an OTP, providing a layer of security that is both intelligent and non-intrusive.

### ü©∫ Automated Diagnosis of Skin Diseases via Deep Learning
*A computer vision model for classifying 24 different types of skin diseases, designed to assist dermatologists and improve diagnostic accessibility.*

![Skin Disease Classification Examples]([LINK_TO_AN_IMAGE_SHOWCASING_SKIN_DISEASE_EXAMPLES])

To tackle the challenge of accurately classifying a wide range of skin conditions, I employed **transfer learning** by fine-tuning a pre-trained **XceptionNet** architecture. The model was trained on a diverse dataset, and I implemented a robust pipeline of **data augmentation** techniques (rotation, zoom, flips) to improve its generalization capabilities across different skin tones and image qualities. This project highlights my ability to adapt state-of-the-art models for specialized medical imaging tasks.
